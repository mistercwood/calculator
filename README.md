### **Features Include:**

* All standard mathematical operators, working on two numbers at a time
* Decimal support, and rounding of results to 5 decimal places to prevent display overflow
* Backspace button in case of mis-keyed digit in current number entry
* Clear-all button
* Better than expected consequences for attempting to divide by zero... ;)
* Full numpad keyboard support, including backspace key and delete for clear-all function

### **Learning Outcomes:**

For this project the thing I learned most about was the importance of planning at the start. I started building my solution in a way that was ultimately going to over-reach the brief of the project, so when I got to the point of starting to meld my functions with user-input I had something that was already in danger of becoming over-engineered.

By forcing myself to revisit the brief and take the time to do some structured planning, I was able to redo the solution as something simpler but with a much quicker turnaround than expected. I also found drawing out my planned logic physically on a cheap whiteboard I picked up one weekend was way more beneficial than expected - I got stuck on a couple of key points along the way and both times I got past the blockers almost immediately once I mapped out the logic visually.
